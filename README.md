# Coverage Optimisation (DPR-enabled Security Variants)

This repository contains a MATLAB simulation framework for coverage optimisation in an energy-constrained WSN/IoT scenario, including optional Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) effects and AES-variant security configurations.

## How to run
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Set the repository root as the current folder.
3. Run:
   - `main.m`

## Outputs
Simulation outputs (figures/results) will be generated during execution. (Describe where they are saved: e.g., `results/`.)

## Configuration
Key parameters can be configured in: (write file names, e.g., `cfg.m` or `config/*.m`)

## Requirements
- MATLAB (tested on: version 2023a)
